# Learning RL

I bought the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow" by Aurélien Géron, published by O'Reilly. I have the second edition.

In the “book” folder, there are different codes that I have copied from the book to learn.


In the folder “neKabuz,” which means “on my own”, I save the different attempts I have made in order.

Inside the ne kabuz folder are the different environments that I have attempted to/managed to resolve.

MountainCar-v0

  f08 was the first to solve MountainCar.
  
  f07 came close but didn't have enough episodes.


  In f07, I used a single model with Reward Shaping, and in f08, I used Double DQN without Reward Shaping.



ALE/Breakout-v5

  Just starting
